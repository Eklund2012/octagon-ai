Next Step
You are done with the "Building" phase. You are now in the "Usage" phase.

Your Weekly Routine:

Download the latest ufc_stats.csv (or update it).

Run the script.

Input the matchups for Saturday night.

Compare your "Fair Odds" to the "Bookie Odds".

If the model spots a discrepancy (like it did with Jones/Aspinall), you have a potential bet.

Would you like a separate, small script that just LOADS the saved model and asks for names (so you don't have to re-train every time)?
