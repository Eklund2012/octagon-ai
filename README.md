# Octagon AI

Octagon AI is a hybrid R and Python project for analyzing UFC fight statistics and predicting fight outcomes using machine learning. This project combines data exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling to provide insights into fighter performance.

## Features
- Data cleaning and exploration using R (`dplyr`, `ggplot2`)
- Machine learning models in Python (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Prediction of fight outcomes
- Visualization of top fighters, strikes, knockdowns, and trends
- Modular design with reusable scripts and Jupyter notebooks

## Folder Structure
- `data/` – Raw and cleaned CSVs
- `python/` – Python scripts for AI modeling
- `r_scripts/` – R scripts for exploration and plotting
- `notebooks/` – Interactive analyses (optional)
- `outputs/` – Saved models, figures, and predictions
